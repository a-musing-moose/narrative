Rules Are Meant To Be Questioned
================================

:tagline: Agile is about not following the rules

*Agile* has been a massivew boon to the software development industry. It has
allowed development teams to embrace change rather than fear it.

It has also encourage development teams to engage with the rest of the
business by strongly suggesting the inclusion of a product owner within
the team itself.

User stories have given us a way to describe the users expectations, their
requirements in a human understandable language, at least at a high level.

Agile has been such a success that organisations with development teams are
attempting to not just scale it up to all their development teams but also
scale it out, moving agile techniques out of the purely development world and
into the organisation as a whole. To mixed success.

One of the core assertions of the agile manifesto is *"People ove process"*.
One that I think is getting a little overshadowed by a slow but continuous
build up of the very processes that agile fights against.

People are odd creatures, full of conflict and contridiction. For example, no
one like to be told what to do and will fight tooth and nail against it. Yet
as communities scale, as organisations become more mature, this is exactly
what happens. They start to build up a set of *rules*. These can be formally
codified as SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) or informally with
explanations of the practices always ending up withe the statement *"This is
how we have always done it"*. This later option is bad. Seriously, if you ever
find yourself saying it, or even just thinking of saying it, stop, take step
back, and really think about it. What are the actual reasons to do something
this way? Do you even know? If not, can you find out? And finally, is the
rationale still relevant?

I also believe that formal, and perhaps to a greater extent, informal rules
stifle innovation. They are an anathema to what I believe is the core of what
it means to be agile.

Rules encourage us to not use our own judgement. They give us something to
hide behind when we cannot or even just can't be bother to make our own minds
up. That is not to say that rules are just bad. They form a foundation on
which to build, a framework to guide thought. I find that the more time I
spend in this field, the greater the chance that when asked for guidance the
answer will be a variation of *"It depends"*. Of course this viewpoint is
taken from a somewhat privileged position. I have had the time to build up
the tools and experience to look at problem and at least have some idea of the
best course for me to take. To use my best judgement. Not that I always get it
right of course.

This was not always the case, none of us are born with this tacit knowledge
built in. It is acquired. Through experience, through mentorship and yes,
through following the *rules* laid down by those that went before us.

So we now find ourselves stuck with the contradictory viewpoints that rules
both stifle innovation and that they are an important source of knowledge that
can be used to guide thought. Ensuring that hard learnt lessons of the past
are not lost of overlooked.

Perhaps it is this aspect of *rules* that we sohuld hold onto? Their use as
guidance in the unfamiliar, the codification of organisational learning. An
opportunity to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past.

Perhaps they should be **guidelines** instead of *rules*.
